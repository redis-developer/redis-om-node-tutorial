  "lyrics": "My laptop upgrades to Windows 10\\nConnect to my phone, but now it’s incompatible\\nRead all the news about the IoT,\\nTurns out that 10.3 can cause connection dropping\\nUpdate my phone, my tablet and my car,\\nIf you can’t take the pace, get out of the race,\\nI’m sure it wasn’t this way, back in the good old days,\\nI’m not stuck in the past, I’m just reverse compatible\\n\\nCHORUS:\\nSystem updates: mandatory,\\nOn my laptop, my TV, and my phone\\nBut these are my own devices, leave them alone\\n\\nBuy a new game, decide to have some fun,\\nThe only catch is there’s a 10Gb patch\\nI’d like to play now, but I can’t see how,\\nSo I poke at some code while I watch it load\\n\\nI was a lonely boy, no friends, no toys\\nIn a world of my own, with a dial-up modem\\nYes, my grades were a mess, but on the BBS,\\nI was always online, I was a system admin\\n\\nCHORUS\\n\\nI was faced with a choice at a critical stage\\nDo we delay the release and face the shareholders’ rage?\\nBut in the back of my head, I knew the bugs could wait,\\nWe could deal with them later in an app update\\n\\nIt’s not a crime when you miss a thing or two,\\nA unit test, a code review\\nYou’re still at work, it’s late at night,\\nDo you get it done, or get it right?\\nTurn off your PC, too tired to cook,\\nPoke at your phone, click some food\\nWho cares if the code is looking 5x5,\\nWe can fix it with an update after we go live\\n\\nCHORUS",
