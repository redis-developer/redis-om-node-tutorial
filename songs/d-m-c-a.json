  "lyrics": "Young man, there’s no need to feel down,\\nI said, young man, you’ve been browsing around,\\nI said, young man, what’s that website you’ve found,\\nWith those hi-def movie downloads,\\n\\nYoung man, look at all of those files,\\nI said, young man, you’ll be here for a while,\\nYou can download, anything you desire,\\nTill your router catches fire,\\n\\nCHORUS:\\nYou’re violating the D M C A , violating the D M C A,\\nThey got everything, you can find it online, you can download it any time\\nBy violating the D M C A, violating the D M C A,\\nAll the new DVDs, special interest movies, even Taylor Swift MP3s,\\n\\nYoung man, well you couldn’t resist,\\nI said young man, now your name’s on a list,\\nI said, young man, got your cease and desist,\\nBut you got to know this one thing,\\n\\nNo man, ever serves any time,\\nI said young man, maybe you’ll pay a fine,\\nAnd tomorrow, you will be back online,\\nYou’ll be downloading day and night,\\n\\nCHORUS\\n\\nYoung man, back when I was your age,\\nIt was usenet, not a link on a page,\\nalt dot binaries, it was where we could go,\\nIf we wanted things to download,\\n\\nNapster, came along with a splash,\\nRecord labels, scared of losing their cash,\\nGot it shut down, by the D M C A,\\nSo we moved to the Pirate Bay",
