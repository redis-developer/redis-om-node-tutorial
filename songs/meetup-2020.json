  "lyrics": "Oh we were all looking for things to inspire us,\\nWhen it was all shut down by coronavirus,\\nNow we’re in lockdown, And nobody is coming round,\\n\\nWe’ve taken all the regulations to heart,\\nWe got to stay at least a metre apart,\\nWear a mask, wash your hands, say goodbye to all your plans.\\n\\nBut do you recall\\nThe jet lag and long haul\\nThe world felt very small,\\nBut now it’s all slowed to a crawl\\nYou know I really miss you all…\\n\\nLet’s all meet up in two thousand twenty,\\nTurn on your webcam and your microphone,\\nWe can still get together, even though we’re home alone,\\nLet’s all pretend that this isn’t weird,\\nCertainly better than drinking on our own,\\nYou might lose inhibitions but\\nyou won’t lose your phone.\\n\\nI’m trying to keep up with the news,\\nBut all the guidance leaves me scared and confused,\\nI’ve got the melancholy corona blues,\\nAnd I’ve forgotten how to put on my shoes,\\n\\nRemember when I said I wanted a break,\\nThat all the travel might have been a mistake,\\nWell now we’re all grounded, it’s not as much fun as it sounded,\\n\\nWhat are you going to do on Monday,\\nSame thing as Saturday and Sunday,\\nEverything blurs into one day,\\nOooo",
